This function should be used to set up Async precache calls at the beginning of the game.  The Precache() function
in addon_game_mode.lua used to and may still sometimes have issues with client's appropriately precaching stuff.
If this occurs it causes the client to never precache things configured in that block.

In this function, place all of your PrecacheItemByNameAsync and PrecacheUnitByNameAsync.  These calls will be made
after all players have loaded in, but before they have selected their heroes. PrecacheItemByNameAsync can also
be used to precache dynamically-added datadriven abilities instead of items.  PrecacheUnitByNameAsync will
precache the precache{} block statement of the unit and all precache{} block statements for every Ability#
defined on the unit.

This function should only be called once.  If you want to/need to precache more items/abilities/units at a later
time, you can call the functions individually (for example if you want to precache units in a new wave of
holdout).
